4. Included the 2 Images of the final Graph that shows up on my computer screen

5. Updated HTML file for the path of css, js and data files as my repository is set up differently and to make everything work

6. Move Mouse on the Chart to see State Name, Poverty Percent and Lack Healthcare Percent

7. Please clone the Directory on your computer so the chart shows up correctly.

8. Note: You'll need to use python -m http.server to run the      visualization. This will host the page at localhost:8000 in your web browser Or if you are using VS Code, Download "Live Server" and Right Click on the index.html file and click on "Open With Live Server"
